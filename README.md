# RhinoInsideCadwork


RhinoInsideCadwork is a tool that allows you to embed Rhino 7 in cadwork 3D. Take advantage of the surface modeller in your cadwork 3D environment.

Combining the two software allows the strengths of the CAD/CAM software to be combined with the strengths of Rhino/Grasshopper.

Make your parametric model production-ready with Rhino.Inside Cadwork.
